            <h5>Identifying our galaxy’s supermassive black hole by tracking stars’ orbits.</h5>
            <p>A black hole is a region of space packed with so much mass that its own gravity prevents anything from escaping—even a ray of light. Although we can’t see a black hole, telescopes can observe the material around it. Matter swirling around a black hole, which can be made up of gas and dust, heats up and emits radiation that can be detected. In some cases, telescopes can observe the gravitational influence of a black hole on the motions of nearby individual stars.</p>
            <p>
            Although a point-like radio source, known as Sagittarius A* (pronounced Sagittarius A-star), was detected at the center of our Milky Way galaxy in the 1970s, researchers could not accurately determine enough of the characteristics of this compact object to precisely describe it. Beginning in the 1990s, astronomers began using new techniques to measure the orbits of the fast-moving stars orbiting this area. By 2008, they not only tracked complete orbits, but also gained enough information to determine the mass of and distances to the stars. At this point, they could confirm that the mass of the object at the center of those orbits is 4.6 million times the mass of our sun and its size can be no bigger than the orbit of Pluto. That meant it could be nothing other than a supermassive black hole. Researchers still track these stars, but for new reasons: to test fundamental physics, including Einstein’s general theory of relativity, which continues to hold up.</p>

            <h2>A STORY OF DARK MATTER: BULLET CLUSTER</h2>
            <h5>Dark matter is an enigma; scientists know more about what it is not than what it is.</h5> 
            <p>The mystery makes it one of the most exciting areas of astronomy. Though dark matter has not been detected with telescopes, we know it exists because of its effect on objects we do see—objects that emit or reflect light. When space is warped by dark matter’s gravity, the light of distant galaxies appears distorted. Using this and other methods, astronomers calculate that there is much more undetectable dark matter in the universe than detectable, “normal” matter.</p>
            <p>
            The Bullet Cluster is composed of two clusters of galaxies that collided and moved past each other, though this is not clear when viewing the region solely in visible light. Multi-wavelength observations of the Bullet Cluster provided the first strong observational evidence that dark matter does not interact with normal matter, or with itself, and holds the majority of mass in a galaxy cluster. Astronomers use visible-light images to map the location of the clusters’ mass, based on how the light of background galaxies is warped. Most of that mass is dark matter. X-rays show that the majority of normal matter, in this case gas, is in a different location than the dark matter of each cluster—it lags behind. This is because the normal matter of the two galaxy clusters collided, while the dark matter sailed through and kept going without interacting at all. Many mysteries remain as to the nature of dark matter, and the Bullet Cluster provides key evidence in the scientific investigation..</p>

            <h2>A STORY OF EXOPLANET DIVERSITY: ATMOSPHERE</h2>
            <h5>Every planet has a unique atmosphere.</h5>
            <p>Researchers have detected thousands of planets orbiting stars other than the Sun. The data show that these planets are even more varied than the planets and moons in our solar system. They range from small rocky planets a fraction of the size of Earth to large gas giants several times the size of Jupiter. Some orbit cool dwarf stars while others circle stars much hotter and more massive than the Sun. And like the objects in our solar system, they have a wide variety of compositions and structures.</p>
            <p>
            Although no exoplanet is close enough to visit with a space probe, we can—under the right conditions—study an exoplanet’s atmosphere. When a planet passes in front of its star, some of the starlight is filtered through the planet’s atmosphere. We can analyze the pattern of the filtered light (a transmission spectrum) to figure out what the atmosphere is made of. The peaks in the graph above represent the amount of light blocked by the exoplanet’s atmosphere – the largest peaks represent more light being filtered out.</p>
            <p>The transmission spectra shown here are models based on assumptions about the composition, temperature, and structure of the exoplanet’s atmosphere. As observatories like the James Webb Space Telescope continue to operate, scientists will compare their data to the models to figure out which assumptions are correct and which are not.</p>

            <h2>A STORY OF INTERACTING GALAXIES: FUTURE OF THE MILKY WAY</h2>
            <h5>Galaxy observations today can be used to predict their changes in the distant future.</h5>
            <p>Galaxies are the universe’s cities of stars, and, like cities they change over time in population, structure, and appearance. Galaxies that interact are drawn toward each other by gravity, and, while stars and planets like our sun and Earth can pass by each other unharmed, the gas between stars collides, heating up and setting off new star formation. If two galaxies of relatively equal mass merge together, eventually the gas and dust will be depleted by this process. The new galaxy resulting from the merger will be home to mature stars, but little to no new star formation.</p>
            <p>
            The Andromeda galaxy’s movement toward us was first measured by American astronomer Vesto Slipher in 1912. More recently, the space telescopes Hubble and Gaia have made precise measurements of Andromeda’s sideways motion, confirming that it and our Milky Way galaxy are on a direct path toward each other, and not just a cosmic fly-by. The images in this slider are an artist’s view of how the night sky will look in the distant future, based on current astronomical measurements. Stargazers of the future appear to be in for quite a show.</p>

            <h2>A STORY OF GATHERING LIGHT: HUBBLE ULTRA DEEP FIELD</h2>
            <h5>Looking at one patch of sky for an extended period of time allow us to see details that are otherwise too faint, small, or distant to distinguish.</h5>
            <p>If you have ever used manual camera controls to photograph in low light, you know that the darker it is, the longer the exposure needs to be. Keeping the camera shutter open longer allows more light to reach the film or detectors. The same is true for a telescope. The more light a telescope can gather, the fainter and more distant the objects it allows us to see.</p>
            <p>
            One way to increase the amount of light a telescope collects is by increasing the amount of time it spends pointed at a particular part of the sky. This is done both by taking extremely long exposures and by adding many separate exposures of the same area together. While one exposure may reveal the presence of a bright source like a star or galaxy, it might not provide much detail, and it won’t reveal dimmer light sources at all. A single exposure is also likely to have a lot of noise from cosmic rays (high-energy charged particles from the Sun and other sources) or random electrical fluctuations in the light detector. When many exposures are added together, noise gets canceled out and real sources of light emerge, becoming brighter and more detailed.</p>
            <p>Long combined-exposure times (tens to hundreds of hours) are particularly useful for looking deep into the universe and creating so-called “deep field” images that reveal the most distant objects known. This is because the longer a telescope looks in any direction, the more time the telescope has to collect light and detect faint sources in that direction. The images shown here reveal more than 10,000 galaxies of different sizes, shapes, colors, distances, ages, and stages of development in a tiny portion of the sky. The black-and-white images capture a single wavelength of near-infrared light. The full-color image is a combination of various colors of visible light, along with ultraviolet and infrared light.</p>

            <h2>A STORY OF GATHERING LIGHT: HUBBLE ULTRA DEEP FIELD</h2>
            <h5>We can detect planets by analyzing starlight.</h5>
            <p>Scientists have detected thousands of exoplanets: planets orbiting stars other than the Sun. We have seen only a few exoplanets directly, but we can detect them by measuring the effects they have on the stars they orbit.</p>
            <p>
            One effect a planet can have is to block some of the star’s light as it passes between the star and the telescope. This is known as a transit. As an exoplanet transits its star, the star appears to dim very slightly. Although the planet itself is too far away to see, we can detect slight changes in the brightness of the star. If we observe a pattern—if the same change in brightness happens a few times at regular intervals—we can infer that a planet is orbiting the star. Analyzing the brightness pattern, or light curve, of the star also helps us figure out the time it takes the planet to orbit (the length of the planet’s year), the size of the planet, and how close it is to its star.</p>
            <p>The light curve shown here is based on Kepler space telescope observations of the star HAT-P-7 and its exoplanet HAT-P-7 b, which was discovered in 2008. Kepler has been used to detect more than 2,300 planets using the transit method. HAT-P-7 b’s large size relative to its star, along with its short orbital period of just over two days, made it relatively easy to detect using the transit method. Because of its size, mass, and high surface temperature, HAT-P-7 b is classified as a “Hot Jupiter” exoplanet.</p>

            <h5>Many of the atoms in your body formed billions of years ago, inside an aging star.</h5>
            <p>Some stars die slowly, giving off puffs of gas and dust before collapsing to form small white dwarf stars. Much larger stars die suddenly in powerful explosions known as supernovas, blasting gas, dust, and energy out in all directions as they collapse to form tiny neutron stars or black holes. The gas and dust expelled by dying stars eventually combines with the remains of others to form new stars, planets, and moons.</p>

            The Crab Nebula is a supernova remnant: the remains of a star whose life ended in a supernova explosion. Observing the different types of light given off by supernova remnants like the Crab Nebula allows us to better understand what happens to massive stars at the end of their lives; to understand what has happened to the matter and energy that made up the star; and better understand where the planets, moons, rock, water, soil—and living things—originally come from.</p>

            <h5>Tracking the outbursts of two tightly orbiting stars.</h5>
            <p>The brightness of some stars varies over time due to a variety of factors, including their age and interactions with other nearby objects. The variation in the brightness of some stars tells us about how they evolve, and helps researchers learn about their properties inside and out.</p>
            <p>
            In the 1840s, what looked like a single star erupted in the night sky. One of the two stars in Eta Carinae ejected some of its mass, brightening the pair and making them the second-brightest star visible in the night sky for more than a decade. These stars are extremely bright and prone to ongoing outbursts, which are causing the stars to lose mass. Observations made in multiple wavelengths of light have allowed researchers to determine the timing of each outburst, as well as the materials it sent out, which formed two lobes of gas and dust. Eta Carinae offers researchers an ongoing opportunity to study massive stars.</p>

            <h2>A STORY OF ANALYZING LIGHT: SPECTRUM OF THE STAR ALTAIR</h2>
            <h5>Patterns in colors of starlight provide important information about the star.</h5>
            <p>Almost everything we know about Altair, a bright star in the constellation Aquila, comes from studying its light. We know that Altair is 10 times brighter than the Sun, rotates once on its axis every 9 hours, has an average surface temperature of about 8,000 degrees Celsius, and is slightly flattened in shape.</p>
            <p>
            There are two main ways to study starlight: with images and with spectra. An image captured by a camera attached to a telescope shows us what the star looks like: its brightness, color, apparent size, and shape. An image can also help us figure out where the star is located relative to other objects in the sky.</p>
            <p>Most scientific telescopes also include spectrographs, tools used to spread light out into a rainbow of light known as a spectrum. A star’s spectrum shows the individual colors that combine to make up the overall color of the star. A spectrum also reveals small variations in the brightness of these different colors. The brightness pattern provides additional details about the star, such as its composition, surface temperature, and how it is moving in space.</p>
            <p>While some spectral features are obvious in a picture of a spectrum, others are very subtle. It is easy to see that there are differences in brightness, but it is almost impossible to tell exactly how bright or dim each color is. In fact, a picture of a spectrum can be deceiving because the human eye and brain perceive colors like blue as darker than colors like yellow, even when blue is brighter. The graph form of a spectrum is important because it shows exactly how bright each individual color (wavelength) of light is relative to every other color.</p>
